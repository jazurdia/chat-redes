## Description
The XMPP client is an instant messaging application developed in React that allows users to connect to an XMPP server, send and receive messages, manage contacts, and change their presence status. It uses the @xmpp/client library for communication with the XMPP server and is configured to work with the alumchat.lol server. The user interface is designed with Tailwind CSS and supports conversation viewing, file sending, and notification management.
